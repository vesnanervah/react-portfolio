        title: "How do I book a shoot?",
        description: "Super simple — just message me through any convenient platform (Instagram, WhatsApp, email, or the contact form on this site). We’ll discuss your preferred date, city, and session type. Once confirmed, I’ll reserve the date for you and send over preparation tips"
    },
    {
        title: "Can I choose the location myself?",
        description: "That depends on the package you choose. On average, sessions last from 1 to 4 hours. We’ll plan the pace and type of shoot together — from relaxed city strolls and love stories to more dynamic or editorial sessions."
    },
    {
        title: "When will I receive the photos?",
        description: "You’ll receive your edited photos within 7–14 days. For event and wedding sessions — up to 30 days. I deliver them in a stylish online gallery, where you can download them in full quality or easily share with friends and family."
    },
    {
        title: "What should I wear?",
        description: "After booking, I’ll send you a style guide with suggestions for colors, textures, and combinations. The most important thing is that you feel confident in your outfit. I’m also happy to help you coordinate looks or plan something cohesive for couples or groups." 
    },
    {
        title: "Do you retouch the photos?",
        description: "Yes, all photos are color-corrected and lightly retouched. My editing style is clean and natural — no overdone filters or fake skin. Just you, at your best. Extra retouching is available upon request." 
    },
    {
        title: "Can I get the raw files?",
        description: "I don’t deliver RAW files. My work includes not only shooting, but also careful selection and editing to create a complete and polished result. You’ll receive only the best images, ready for printing, sharing, or publishing."
